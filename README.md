# Git Auto Commit Only

It is a simple plugin that automatically performs only **Git Commit** and **Push**.  
For security, it is written with minimal code, and without requiring any Git repository access permissions, it simply executes the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands in the current folder.
